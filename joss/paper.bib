  journal   = {Environmental Research Letters},
  abstract  = {We estimated CO2 emissions from the Beijing region of China using differential ground-based observations of the column-averaged dry air mole fractions of CO2 (; urban minus upwind background column observations) in winter (1 November 2020–1 March 2021). Beijing is one of the most world’s populated cities and the CO2 emissions from this region contain large uncertainties in different bottom-up anthropogenic inventories. Differential measurements are potentially able to capture urban signals over Beijing (3.46 ± 2.35 ppm). The simulated XCO2 enhancements were calculated () based on three emission inventories (the Open-source Data Inventory for Anthropogenic CO2 (ODIAC), Multiresolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC) and Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) datasets) for Beijing. The values based on the ODIAC dataset were much higher than the observations, whereas the values from the EDGAR dataset were much lower and the MEIC dataset was more consistent. We performed a Lagrangian inversion framework based on Bayesian theory. The average and uncertainty of a priori estimates (12.18 ± 8.0, 7.09 ± 7.5 and 3.53 ± 11.4 μmol (m2 s)−1) were optimized to the posterior emissions (9.44 ± 5.7, 7.13 ± 4.9 and 7.15 ± 5.7 μmol (m2 s)−1), suggesting that the three posterior estimates tended to converge to become more consistent, transport errors (especially the horizontal transport errors) and the spatially uneven corrections in Beijing were the main reason for the differences between the posterior estimates. Sensitivity tests suggested that the prescribed spatial and temporal structures affected up to about 12.9%, 4.9% and 20.8%, respectively, of the three inventories.}

  abstract = {Abstract This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that methane (CH4) emissions from natural gas (NG) and agriculture can be disentangled using the concept of excess column observations. A network of cost-effective sensors measured excess column-averaged dry-air mole fractions for CH4 (ΔXCH4), ethane (ΔXC2H6 as NG tracer), and ammonia (ΔXNH3 from agriculture) in the Denver-Julesburg Basin during March 2015. ΔXCH4 varied up to 17 ppb and was >3 times higher with winds from directions where NG is produced. The ΔXCH4 variance is explained by variations in the C2H6-NH3 tracer pair, attributing 63 ± 17\% to NG, 25 ± 10\% to agriculture, and 12 ± 12\% to other sources. The ratios ΔXC2H6/ΔXCH4 (16 ± 2\%; indicates wet NG) and ΔXNH3/ΔXCH4 (43 ± 12\%) were compatible with in situ measured ratios. Excess columns are independent of boundary layer height, characterize gases in the open atmosphere, are inherently calibrated, average over extended spatial scales, and provide a complementary perspective to quantify and attribute CH4 emissions on regional scales.},
