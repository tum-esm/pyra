## What is Pyra?

Pyra (name based on [Python](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)>) and [Ra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra)) is a software that automates the operation of [EM27/SUN](https://www.bruker.com/en/products-and-solutions/infrared-and-raman/remote-sensing/em27-sun-solar-absorption-spectrometer.html) measurement setups. Operating EM27/SUN devices requires a lot of human interaction. Pyra makes it possible to operate these devices 24/7 autonomously.

Pyra has enabled us, the **[Professorship of Environmental Sensing and Modeling](https://www.ee.cit.tum.de/en)** at the **[Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en)** to collect continuous data from 5 stations around the city of Munich since 2019 using [MUCCnet](https://atmosphere.ei.tum.de/). Versions 1 to 3 of Pyra have been experimental tools improved internally since 2016. The goal of version 4 is to make Pyra even more stable, easy to understand and extend, and usable by the whole EM27/SUN community.

## Citing Pyra

Whenever using data generated by Pyra, please make sure to cite the following two papers. With the first one (MUCCnet), we developed the versions 1 to 3 of Pyra internally. With the second one (Pyra), we turned Pyra into a reusable open-source software.
