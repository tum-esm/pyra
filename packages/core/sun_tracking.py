# CamTracker is a software that controls two electro motors that are connected
# to mirrors. It tracks the sun movement and allows the spectrometer to follow
# the sun in the course of the day.

# TODO: Implement this for the "Camtracker" software
# Later, make an abstract base class that enforces a standard interface
# to be implemented for any software like "Camtracker"

# TODO: Mock the behaviour of OPUS when testing
