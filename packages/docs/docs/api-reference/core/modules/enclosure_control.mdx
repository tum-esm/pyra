## <kbd>class</kbd> `EnclosureControl`
EnclosureControl allows to interact with TUM made weather protected enclosures that allow a 24/7 deployment of the FTIR spectrometer EM27/Sun in the field. The class takes the latest decision from measurement_conditions.py (StateInterface: measurements_should_be_running) and communicates with the enclosure's built in Siemens S7 PLC to read and write parameters to its database (PLCInterface). Additionally, it powers down the spectrometer during dusk to extend the overall spectrometer lifetime. During dawn, it powers up the spectrometer to prepare and warm it up for the next measurement day. At initialization, the PLC is set to control the ambient enclosure temperature in automatic mode. During flank changes of measurements_should_be_running it either tells the enclosure to open up the cover to allow direct sunlight to hit the CamTracker mirrors or close the cover to protect the instrument. Instrument protection from bad weather conditions is always prioritised over a slight maximization of measurement uptime.

### <kbd>method</kbd> `__init__`

```python
__init__(initial_config: ConfigDict)
```

### <kbd>method</kbd> `auto_set_power_spectrometer`

```python
auto_set_power_spectrometer() → None
```

Shuts down spectrometer if the sun angle is too low. Starts up the spectrometer in the morning when minimum angle is satisfied.

### <kbd>method</kbd> `force_cover_close`

```python
force_cover_close() → None
```

Emergency option to call to ensure that the cover is closed immediately. Accounts for possible blocking conditions caused by the PLC internals: 1. Reset needed 2. Sync to tracker still active 3. Manual control not active

### <kbd>method</kbd> `move_cover`

```python
move_cover(value: int) → None
```

Moves the cover attached on top of the enclosure. The cover is moved by a electrical motor controlled by the PLC. The cover functions as weather protection for the measurement instrument. In case of bad weather the PLC takes over control and closes the cover itself. A movement of the cover during bad weather conditions shall not be allowed as instrument saefty is priotized higher than maximization of overall measurement uptime.

### <kbd>method</kbd> `run`

```python
run(new_config: ConfigDict) → None
```

Called in every cycle of the main loop. Updates enclosure state based on the current automation status.

### <kbd>method</kbd> `sync_cover_to_measurement_status`

```python
sync_cover_to_measurement_status() → None
```

Checks for flank changes in parameter measurement_should_be_running. Positive flank: Set sync_cover flag in PLC to start matching the Camtracker mirror position. Negative flank: Remove sync_cover flag in PLC and move cover to position 0.

### <kbd>method</kbd> `verify_cover_position`

```python
verify_cover_position() → None
```

Verifies that the cover is closed when measurements are currently not set to be running. Closed the cover in case of a mismatch. 

This functions allows to detect desync caused by previous user controlled decisions. It also functions as a failsafe to ensure weather protection of the instrument.

### <kbd>method</kbd> `verify_cover_sync`

```python
verify_cover_sync() → None
```

Syncs the current cover_sync flag in the PLC with the present measurement status. 

This functions allows to detect desync caused by previous user controlled decisions.

### <kbd>method</kbd> `wait_for_cover_closing`

```python
wait_for_cover_closing(throw_error: bool = True) → None
```

Validates the progress of a cover closing call. Continues when cover is closed. Validation is done every 5s with a maximum waiting time of 60s. 

Raises the custom error CoverError if clover doesn't close in time.
