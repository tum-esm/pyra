## <kbd>function</kbd> `update_exception_state`

```python
update_exception_state(
    config: ConfigDict,
    current_exceptions: list[str],
    new_exception: Optional[Exception]
) → list[str]
```

Take a list of current_exceptions (all exceptions that are present from the last mainloop iteration, possibly empty) and a new_exception (the one that happened in this loop, possibly None). 

If the new_exception is None, all exceptions have been resolved resolved: send a "resolved" email in case the current_exceptions was not empty yet. 

If the new_exception is not None, if it is not already in the list of current_exceptions: append it to that list and send a "new error occured" email.

## <kbd>function</kbd> `run`

```python
run() → None
```

The mainloop of PYRA Core. This function will loop infinitely. It loads the config file, validates it runs every module one by one, and possibly restarts the upload- and helios-thread.
