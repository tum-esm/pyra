# <kbd>module</kbd> `core.main`

## <kbd>function</kbd> `run`

```python
run() â†’ None
```

The entrypoint of PYRA Core. 

This function infinitely loops over a sequence of modules: 

1. Read the config 

2. Check whether `HeliosThread` and `UploadThread` are running 

3. Possibly start/stop the threads according to the config 

4. Run `MeasurementConditions` module 

5. Run `EnclosureControl` module 

6. Run `SunTracking` module 

7. Run `OpusMeasurement` module 

8. Run `SystemChecks` module 

The mainloop logs all exceptions and sends out emails when new exceptions occur and when all exceptions have been resolved. 

**Terminology:** modules are executed one by one in each mainloop iteration. Threads are executed in parallel to the mainloop and are started/stopped according to the config.
