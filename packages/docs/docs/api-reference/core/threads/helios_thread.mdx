### <kbd>method</kbd> `__init__`

```python
__init__(logger: Logger, camera_id: int, initialization_tries: int = 5) → None
```

### <kbd>method</kbd> `adjust_exposure`

```python
adjust_exposure() → None
```

This function will loop over all available exposures and take one image for each exposure. Then it sets exposure to the value where the overall mean pixel value color is closest to 50. 

**For every exposure:** 

1. set new exposure 2. 0.3s sleep 3. image 1 -> 0.1s sleep -> image 2 -> 0.1s sleep -> image 3 8. calculate mean color of all 3 images 9. save images to disk

### <kbd>method</kbd> `get_available_exposures`

```python
get_available_exposures() → list[int]
```

Loop over every integer in [-20, ..., +20] and try to set the camera exposure to each value. Return a list of integers that the camera accepted as an exposure setting.

### <kbd>method</kbd> `run`

```python
run(station_id: str, edge_color_threshold: int, save_image: bool) → float
```

Take an image and evaluate the sun conditions. Run autoexposure function every 5 minutes. Returns the edge fraction.

### <kbd>method</kbd> `take_image`

```python
take_image(
    retries: int = 10,
    trow_away_white_images: bool = True
) → ndarray[Any, Any]
```

Take an image using the initialized camera. Raises an AssertionError if camera has not been set up. 

Retries up to n times (camera can say "not possible") and throws away all mostly white images (overexposed) except when specified not to (used in autoexposure).

### <kbd>method</kbd> `update_camera_settings`

```python
update_camera_settings(
    exposure: int,
    brightness: int = 64,
    contrast: int = 64,
    saturation: int = 0,
    gain: int = 0,
    width: int = 1280,
    height: int = 720
) → None
```

Update the settings of the connected camera. Which settings are available depends on the camera model. However, this function will throw an AssertionError, when the value could not be changed.

## <kbd>class</kbd> `HeliosThread`
Thread for determining the current sun conditions in a parallel mainloop. 

"Good" sun conditions with respect to EM27 measurements means direct sunlight, i.e. no clouds in front of the sun. Interferograms recored in diffuse light conditions result in a concentration timeseries (after retrieval) with a very large standard deviation. 

Direct sunlight can be determined by "hard" shadows, i.e. quick transitions between light and dark surfaces. This thread periodically takes images in a special camera setup and uses edge detected to determine how many hard shadows it can find in the image. 

The result of this constant sunlight evaluation is written to the StateInterface.

### <kbd>method</kbd> `main`

```python
main(headless: bool = False) → None
```

Main entrypoint of the thread. In headless mode,  don't write to log files but print to console.

### <kbd>method</kbd> `should_be_running`

```python
should_be_running(config: Config) → bool
```

Based on the config, should the thread be running or not?
