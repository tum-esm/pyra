## <kbd>class</kbd> `with_filelock`
Decorator that wraps a semaphor around a function. 

FileLock = Mark, that a file is being used and other programs should not interfere. A file "*.lock" will be created and the content of this file will make the wrapped function possibly wait until other programs are done using it. 

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_(programming)

### <kbd>method</kbd> `__init__`

```python
__init__(file_lock_path: str, timeout: float = -1) â†’ None
```

A timeout of -1 means that the code waits forever
