# Functionality

Measurements with an EM27/SUN require you to run CamTracker - the software that tracks the sun position and operates the mirrors accordingly - and OPUS - the software that sends commands to the EM27/SUN and collects the output data into interferogram files. Fully automated setups usually have a weather protection enclosure and possibly custom hardware to evaluate measurement conditions.

Pyra bridges the gap between the components required to automate your EM27/SUN setup. Based on certain conditions - time, sun angle, or sun condition (see [User Guide > TUM PLC and Helios](/docs/user-guide/tum-enclosure-and-helios)) - Pyra decides whether to perform measurements or not. This decision can also be outsourced to your own logic and passed to Pyra via CLI commands or done manually with a button in the UI (see [User Guide > Measurements](/docs/user-guide/measurements)).

Pyra monitors the measurement process and operating system stability (disk space, CPU usage, etc.), permanently logs its activity and sends emails when errors occur/have been resolved.
