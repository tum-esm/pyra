# Functionality

Measurements with an EM27/SUN require you to run CamTracker - the software that tracks the sun position and operates the mirrors accordingly - and OPUS - the software that sends commands to the EM27/SUN and collects the output data into interferogram files.

Based on certain conditions - time, sun angle, or sun condition (see [Helios](/docs/user-guide/tum-plc-and-helios)) - Pyra decides whether to perform measurements or not.

Pyra can handle both interfaces to start and stop measurement activity. This can either be done manually (clicking a button in the GUI), automatically, or via a CLI command. In addition, Pyra monitors the measurement process and operating system stability (disk space, CPU usage, etc.), permanently logs its activity and sends out emails when errors occur/have been resolved.
