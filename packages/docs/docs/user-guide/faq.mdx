# FAQ

## Can we use Pyra on an offline system?

Yes. Pyra only requires an internet connection for the installation. Pyra releases from 4.0.8 download astronomical data (until 2053) during installation, so no further internet connection during operation is required.

## During Setup, the following error occurs: "executing `.ps1` scripts is not allowed due to an ExecutionPolicy"

This can be solved by running the following command in a PowerShell (credits to https://stackoverflow.com/a/49112322/8255842):

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```

## Pyra Shows a `filelock._error.Timeout` Exception

In theory, Pyra may encounter a deadlock when reading state or log files - although we have never experienced it yet. The error message will say something like this:

```
filelock._error.Timeout: The file lock 'C:\Users\ga56fem\Downloads\pyra\pyra-4.0.6\config\.state.lock' could not be acquired.
```

You can use the CLI command `pyra-cli remove-filelocks` to resolve that.

:::note

We are using the python library `filelock` to enforce exclusive use of state- and log-files: There should not be two processes simultaneously interacting with one of these files. This is necessary because we have at least 4 processes that work with these files: the CLI and the main-, upload- and helios-thread.
