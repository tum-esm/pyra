# The Upload Process

## Interferograms Directory Structure

We have set up our OPUS macro files to produce a directory structure like this:

```
📁 <IFG OUTPOUT DIR>
    📁 YYYYMMDD
        📄 stationid-YYYYMMDD.0001
        📄 stationid-YYYYMMDD.0002
        📄 ...
    📁 YYYYMMDD
        📄 stationid-YYYYMMDD.0001
        📄 stationid-YYYYMMDD.0002
        📄 ...
```

:::note

When using [Helios](/docs/user-guide/tum-plc-and-helios), saved images will be stored inside `/logs/helios/` in the same directory structure as the interferograms output directory. This is why the upload can be used for both types of data.

We will expand this to be useable for an arbitrary number of directories in the future: See [GitHub](https://github.com/tum-esm/pyra/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Update%3A+Upload+Improvements%22).

## How the Upload works

The upload uses an `upload-meta.json` file in each `YYYYMMDD` directory to save the upload state. You should not modify this file or the `YYYYMMDD` directories manually! Example file:

```json
{
    "complete": false,
    "fileList": ["file 1", "file 2", "..."],
    "createdTime": 0,
    "lastModifiedTime": 0
}
```

The upload can handle interruptions and continue where it was stopped. After uploading each directory, Pyra will calculate a checksum locally and remotely - this is why the server needs to have Python 3.10 installed. Only when the checksums match, the `upload-meta.json` will get a `complete = true` indicator.

The idea of the `complete=true` flag is that the post-processing should only consider data where the upload is complete.

## Measures to ensure upload integrity

1. The `complete=true` flag will also only be set, when the checksums match.

2. The local files will only be deleted when the checksums of the local and remote directory are equal: Every missing, additional, or modified file in the `fileList` will change the checksum.

3. We wrote a test script that generates a bunch of sample directories and sample files, runs the upload, and checks the final upload state. See [/docs/developer-guide/testing-and-ci](/docs/developer-guide/testing-and-ci).
