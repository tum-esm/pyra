# Measurement Modes and Triggers

The **measurement decision** (whether measurements should run or not) depends on the **measurement mode**:

- **Automatic mode:** Measurement decision is made based on defined triggers (see below)
- **Manual mode:** A start/stop button for manual control
- **CLI mode:** The config contains a field where the CLI can add a decision result

:::tip

CLI mode can be used when you have already built a system that evaluates measurement conditions and you want to use Pyra for the rest of the operation. Respective CLI commands are in the [next section](#cli-command-line-interface).

In the automation tab, Pyra's measurement mode can be selected.

In the configuration tab, you can select measurement triggers that should be considered in automatic mode. When multiple triggers are set, all triggers must be positive to start measurements (e.g., "above a certain sun angle AND between start and end time").

**Helios** is our module to determine whether direct sunlight (required by the EM27/SUN) is present. Please read about it [here](/docs/user-guide/tum-enclosure-and-helios).
