# Measurement Modes

The **"measurement decision"** (whether measurements should run or not) depends on the **"measurement mode"**:

- **Automatic mode:** Measurement decision is made based on defined triggers (see below)
- **Manual mode:** A start/stop button for manual control
- **CLI mode:** The config contains a field where the CLI can add a decision result

Pyra's measurement mode can be selected in the overview tab. In the logs and in the codebase, this system of determining whether to measure or not is called **Condition Assessment System (CAS)**.

## Automatic Mode

In automatic mode, Pyra does measurements when certain conditions are met:

- start/stop time
- minimum sun elevation
- Helios

In the configuration tab, you can select measurement triggers that should be considered in automatic mode. When multiple triggers are set, all triggers must be positive to start measurements (e.g., "above a certain sun elevation AND between start and end time").

**Helios** is our module to determine whether direct sunlight (required by the EM27/SUN) is present. Please read about it [here](/docs/user-guide/tum-enclosure-and-helios).

## Manual Mode

In manual mode, the system will always measure, when the sun is about the value configured at `config.general.min_sun_elevation` (you can set this to negative values too).

## CLI Mode

CLI mode can be used when you have already built a system that evaluates measurement conditions and you want to tell Pyra when to start and stop measurements from an external source. Respective CLI commands are in the [next section](#cli-command-line-interface).
