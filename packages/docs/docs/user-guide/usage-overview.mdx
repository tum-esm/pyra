# Usage Overview

:::tip

How to start/stop measurements and control PYRA from another system/automation will be covered in the next section [Measurements](/docs/user-guide/measurements).

:::

## Parts of Pyra

The three parts of Pyra are:

-   **Pyra Core:** Running in the background, looping over all automation steps infinitely in a defined interval.
-   **Pyra CLI:** Command Line Interface (CLI) used to interact with Pyra Core
-   **Pyra UI:** Graphical user Interface (GUI) used to interact with Pyra Core and send Pyra CLI commands

## Pyra Core

For a description of how the core works, please read the [Developer Guide](/docs/category/developer-guide).

## GUI (Graphical User Interface)

This is how the GUI looks. The tab "PLC Controls" only appears when you have configured the [TUM PLC](/docs/user-guide/tum-plc-and-helios).

When changes are made to the `config.json` file directly (not from the GUI), a popup will appear, telling you to reload the window:

:::note

We are currently experiencing a bug on some systems that the "config has changed, reload required" popup shows up when changes were made through the GUI. Also, the popup appears multiple times. This should be resolved in the future.

The issue progress can be tracked here: https://github.com/tum-esm/pyra/issues/106

## Logs

Pyra will store all of its activity in log files. The files `info.log` and `debug.log` will only contain logs from the past hour. Older log lines will be archived periodically to keep the main log files easy to parse.

```
📁 <DOCUMENTS DIR>
    📁 pyra
        📁 pyra-x.y.z
            📁 logs
                📄 info.log
                📄 debug.log
                📁 archive
                    📄 YYYYMMDD-info.log
                    📄 YYYYMMDD-debug.log
                    📄 ...
```

Inside the Logs tab, the content from the log files will be fetched every 10 seconds. The debug level includes more information. The log fetching can be paused (on the "live" button) for analyzing logs in detail. There is a button that opens the `pyra/pyra-x.y.z/logs` folder in the file explorer.

## Error Emails

Whenever Pyra encounters any errors, it sends out emails to a list of recipients. An "error resolved" email helps with self-resolving issues and team communication - so that others get notified when the problem is not present anymore.

**When errors occur:**

    className='tw-rounded-lg tw-mb-4'
/>

**When errors are resolved:**

<img
    src='/img/docs/email-errors-resolved.png'
    className='tw-rounded-lg tw-mb-4'
/>

:::note

The "CoverError" comes from the TUM PLC Module controlling our weather protection enclosure.
