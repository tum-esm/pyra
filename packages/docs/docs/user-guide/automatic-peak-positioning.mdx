# Automatic Peak Positioning (APP)

Whenever powering up the spectrometer, the EM27/SUN does not know position of the pendulum fully accurate. That is why it is recommended to save the center position of recorded interferograms after every power up so that no points on one ifg side get lost because it is not stored centered. In OPUS, you can do this in "Measure > Setup Measurement Parameters > Check Signal". Or you can let PYRA do this after every power up by configuring it in the OPUS Configuration and save a few minutes per system per day.


The logs from the OPUS thread when performing the APP will look something like this:

Ensure to unload the interferogram files frequently because the files loaded by OPUS cannot be read by any other program. Otherwise, you will see many `Permission denied` exceptions until Pyra finds the first interferogram file from which to read the peak position.
