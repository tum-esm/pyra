# Pyra 4 Documentation

## What is Pyra?

Pyra (name based on [Python](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)>) and [Ra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra)) is a software that automates the operation of [EM27/SUN](https://www.bruker.com/en/products-and-solutions/infrared-and-raman/remote-sensing/em27-sun-solar-absorption-spectrometer.html) measurement setups. Operating EM27/SUN devices requires a lot of human interaction. Pyra makes it possible to operate these devices 24/7 autonomously.

Pyra has enabled the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/) to collect continuous data from 5 stations around the city of Munich since 2019 using [MUCCnet](https://atmosphere.ei.tum.de/). Versions 1 to 3 of Pyra have been experimental tools improved internally since 2016.

The goal of Pyra version 4 is to make it even more stable, easy to understand and extend, and usable by the broad EM27/SUN community.

The software is licensed under GPLv3 and is [open-sourced on GitHub (https://github.com/tum-esm/pyra)](https://github.com/tum-esm/pyra). Whenever using Pyra, please make sure to cite the codebase.

## About This Documentation

This documentation page serves as a guide for both users and developers. By user, we mean people operating Pyra on their EM27/SUN stations. By developers, we target people working on the Pyra 4 codebase itself.

-   How to [set it up](/docs/user-guide/setup)
-   Overview of [how to use it](/docs/user-guide/usage-overview)
-   How [starting and stopping measurements via CLI or UI](/docs/user-guide/measurements) works
-   How the [upload](/docs/user-guide/upload) works
-   What the [TUM PLC and Helios](/docs/user-guide/tum-plc-and-helios)
-   Answers to [frequently asked euestions](/docs/user-guide/faq)

**For developers:**

-   High level view of the [architecture](/docs/developer-guide/architecture)
-   [Interfaces between program parts](/docs/developer-guide/internal-interfaces)
-   [Interfaces to external programs](/docs/developer-guide/external-interfaces)

-   Our [code of conduct](/docs/contributor-guide/code-of-conduct)
-   API reference of Core/UI/CLI (👈 see sidebar)

The [contact section](/docs/intro/contact) contains author and contact information and ways to report bugs and suggest new features.

:::info

Pyra 4 is _not_ built to be imported as a library but rather to be run as a standalone program. The desired way to interact with Pyra 4 programmatically
is via the CLI.

If you want to extend Pyra 4 itself, the developer guide serves as a high-level introduction to the codebase structure. All code is statically typed, and all functions contain doc strings.
