# Pyra 4 Documentation

## What is Pyra?

Pyra (name based on [Python](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)>) and [Ra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra)) is a software that automates the operation of [EM27/SUN](https://www.bruker.com/en/products-and-solutions/infrared-and-raman/remote-sensing/em27-sun-solar-absorption-spectrometer.html) measurement setups. Operating EM27/SUN devices requires a lot of human interaction. Pyra makes it possible to autonomously operate these devices 24/7.

Pyra has enabled the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/) to collect continuous data from 5 stations around the city of Munich since 2019 using [MUCCnet](https://atmosphere.ei.tum.de/). Versions 1 to 3 of Pyra have been experimental tools, improved internally since 2016.

The goal of Pyra version 4 is to make it even more stable, easy to understand and extend, and usable by the broad EM27/SUN community.

The software is licensed under GPLv3 and is [open-sourced on GitHub](https://github.com/tum-esm/pyra). Whenever using Pyra, please make sure to cite the codebase.

## About This Documentation

This documentation page serves as a guide for both users and developers. By user, we mean people operating Pyra on their EM27/SUN stations. By developers, we target people working on the Pyra 4 codebase itself.

-   How to [set it up](/docs/user-guide/setup)
-   Overview of [how to use it](/docs/user-guide/usage-overview)
-   How [starting and stopping measurements via CLI or UI](/docs/user-guide/measurements) works
-   How the [upload](/docs/user-guide/upload) works
-   What the [TUM PLC and Helios](/docs/user-guide/tum-plc-and-helios)

The [contact section](/docs/intro/contact) contains author and contact information, as well as ways to report bugs and suggest new features.

:::info

This documentation is **not an API reference**. Pyra 4's code is statically typed, and all functions contain doc strings - hence, the API reference is in the codebase itself. The developer guide serves as a high-level intro to the codebase structure.
