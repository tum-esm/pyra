## What is Pyra?

Pyra (name based on [Python](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)>) and [Ra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra)) is a software that automates the operation of [EM27/SUN](https://www.bruker.com/en/products-and-solutions/infrared-and-raman/remote-sensing/em27-sun-solar-absorption-spectrometer.html) measurement setups. Operating EM27/SUN devices requires a lot of human interaction. Pyra makes it possible to operate these devices 24/7 autonomously.

Pyra has enabled us, the **[Professorship of Environmental Sensing and Modeling](https://www.ee.cit.tum.de/en)** at the **[Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en)** to collect continuous data from 5 stations around the city of Munich since 2019 using [MUCCnet](https://atmosphere.ei.tum.de/). Versions 1 to 3 of Pyra have been experimental tools improved internally since 2016. The goal of version 4 is to make Pyra even more stable, easy to understand and extend, and usable by the whole EM27/SUN community.

The software is licensed under GPLv3 and is open-sourced on GitHub: https://github.com/tum-esm/pyra. Pyra has been published in the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS): https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.05131.

## About This Documentation

This documentation page serves as a guide for both users and developers. By user, we mean people operating Pyra on their EM27/SUN stations. By developers, we target people working on the Pyra 4 codebase itself.

**For users:**

- Overview of [what Pyra 4 does](/docs/user-guide/functionality)
- How to [set it up](/docs/user-guide/setup)
- Overview of [how to use it](/docs/user-guide/usage-overview)
- How [starting and stopping measurements via CLI or UI](/docs/user-guide/measurements) works
- How the [upload](/docs/user-guide/upload) works
- What the [TUM PLC and Helios](/docs/user-guide/tum-plc-and-helios)
- Answers to [frequently asked euestions](/docs/user-guide/faq)

**For developers:**

- High level view of the [architecture](/docs/developer-guide/architecture)
- [Interfaces between program parts](/docs/developer-guide/internal-interfaces)
- [Interfaces to external programs](/docs/developer-guide/external-interfaces)
- How to [manually run the parts of Pyra](/docs/developer-guide/running-pyra-manually)
- How [the repository is organized](/docs/developer-guide/repository-organization)
- How [testing and continuous integration](/docs/developer-guide/testing-and-ci) is set up

**For contributors:**

- How to [become a contributor](/docs/contributor-guide/becoming-a-contributor)
- Our [code of conduct](/docs/contributor-guide/code-of-conduct)
- API reference of Core/UI/CLI (ðŸ‘ˆ see sidebar)

The [contact section](/docs/intro/contact) contains author and contact information and ways to report bugs and suggest new features.

:::info

Pyra 4 is _not_ built to be imported as a library but rather to be run as a standalone program. The desired way to interact with Pyra 4 programmatically
is via the CLI.

If you want to extend Pyra 4 itself, the developer guide serves as a high-level introduction to the codebase structure. All code is statically typed, and all functions contain doc strings.

## Citing Pyra

Whenever using data generated by Pyra, please make sure to cite the following two papers. With the first one (MUCCnet), we developed the versions 1 to 3 of Pyra internally. With the second one (Pyra), we turned Pyra into a reusable open-source software.
