# Interfaces to external programs

## OPUS

We are using the `pywin32` Python library which provides an interface to the [Windows DDE APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Data_Exchange). Pyra Core uses DDE to communicate with OPUS: Loading experiment files, starting and stopping macros, and stopping OPUS itself.

```python
import dde

# initialize DDE client
server = dde.CreateServer()
server.Create("Client")
conversation = dde.CreateConversation(server)

# connect to OPUS
conversation.ConnectTo("OPUS", "OPUS/System")
assert self.conversation.Connected()

# send a command to OPUS
macro_path = "..."
answer = conversation.Request(f"RUN_MACRO {macro_path}")
logger.info(f"Started OPUS macro: {macro_path}")
```

:::note

We are working on improving the reliability of that connection: https://github.com/tum-esm/pyra/issues/124

## CamTracker

The `CamTrackerConfig.txt` file contains coordinates that Pyra Core uses in its Astronomy utility class. The coordinates can be found by looking for the `$1` mark inside the file:

```
...

$1
48.15
11.57
0.54

...
```

The `LEARN_Az_Elev.dat` file contains CamTracker's logs about mirror position and currently estimated sun position. Example:

```dat
Julian Date, Tracker Elevation, Tracker Azimuth, Elev Offset from Astro, Az Offset from Astro, Ellipse distance/px
 2458332.922778,107.490800,149.545000,0.197305,0.188938,705.047211
 2458332.922836,107.494400,149.761400,0.192179,0.365420,736.914133
 2458332.922905,107.498400,150.208200,0.188914,0.778934,736.914133
 2458332.922975,107.499200,149.811600,0.179557,0.335728,736.914133
 2458332.923032,107.508400,149.647800,0.182958,0.145281,736.914133
 ...
```

The `SunIntensity.dat` file contains CamTracker's own evaluation of the sun conditions. This is currently not used in Pyra Core but might be in the future. Example:

```dat
Julian Date, Date UTC[yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss], Intensity[px*ms], big and small obj good
 2457057.199028, 2015/02/03 16:46:36, 0.000000,     good
 2457057.200347, 2015/02/03 16:48:30, 0.000000,     good
 2458332.906019, 2018/08/02 09:44:40, 0.000000,     good
 2458332.906088, 2018/08/02 09:44:46,      nan,      bad
 2458332.906169, 2018/08/02 09:44:53,      nan,      bad
 ...
```

When stopping CamTracker, we have to add a `stop.txt` inside CamTracker's code directory and the application will shut down gracefully.

## TUM PLC

We are using the Snap7 Python library to communicate with the TUM PLC. Here is a manual for the underlying Snap7 API: http://snap7.sourceforge.net/sharp7.html
