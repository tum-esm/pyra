## Branch Structure

**Branches:** `development-...`, `integration-x.y.z`, `main`, `release`, `prerelease`

**Hierarchy:**

-   `development-...` contains stuff in active development and will be merged into `integration-x.y.z`.
-   `integration-x.y.z` is used during active station integration and will be merged into `main`.
-   `main` contains the latest running version that passed the integration and will be merged into `release` once enough changes have accumulated. Any branch can be released into `prerelease` to run the CI-Pipeline on demand.
-   `prerelease` will not be merged into anything else and is just used for development.

## Issues and Releases

Things we work on are managed via issues - bundled into milestones (each milestone represents a release). The issues should be closed once they are on the `main` branch via commit messages or pull requests ("closes #87", "fixes #70", etc. see [this list of keywords](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword)).

**Issue Labels:**

Planned releases are described on [GitHub](https://github.com/tum-esm/pyra/milestones).

:::info

We integrate new releases on two different machines. When the new software runs smoothly for some time, we make it an official release.

## Version numbers

Versions up to 4.0.4 are alpha and beta versions that should not be used regularly. Pyra can be generally used starting from version 4.0.5.

Inside the codebase, the version number is included 3 times: `pyproject.toml`, `packages/ui/package.json`, `packages/ui/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`. The script `scripts/sync_version_numbers.py` takes the version number from the `.toml` file and pastes it into the other locations. This script can be run in a [git-hook](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks).
