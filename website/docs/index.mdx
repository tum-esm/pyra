# PYRA 4 Documentation

## What is PYRA?

PYRA (name based on [Python](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)>) and [Ra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra)) is a software that automates the operation of [EM27/SUN](https://www.bruker.com/en/products-and-solutions/infrared-and-raman/remote-sensing/em27-sun-solar-absorption-spectrometer.html) measurement setups. Operating EM27/SUN devices normally requires a lot of human interaction. PYRA makes it possible to operate these devices 24/7 with almost no human interaction.

PYRA has enabled us - the [Associate Professorship of Environmental Sensing and Modeling](https://www.ee.cit.tum.de/en/esm/home/) at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/) - to collect 3 years of continuous data from 5 stations around the city of munich using [MUCCnet](https://atmosphere.ei.tum.de/). PYRA 1 to 3 have been experimental software tools improved internally over the last 5 years.

The goal of version 4 of this software is to make it even more stable, easy to understand and extend and usable by other EM27/SUN-equipped teams.

<!-- TODO: Link to PYRA 4 lincense file -->

The software has a GPLv3 license and is [open-source on GitHub](https://github.com/tum-esm/pyra). We are currently in the review process of a paper for [JOSS (The Journal of Open Source Software)](https://joss.theoj.org/). Whenever using PYRA, please make sure to cite the codebase - or the paper once available.

## About This Documentation

This documentation page serves as a guide for both users and developers. By user, we mean people running PYRA on their EM27/SUN stations. By developers, we mean people working on the PYRA 4 codebase itself.

<!-- TODO: add user documents and links -->

**For users** it contains an overview of [what PYRA 4 does](user-guide/functionality), how to [set it up](user-guide/setup), how to [use it](user-guide/usage), how to work with the [command line interface](user-guide/cli), how the [upload](user-guide/upload) works, what the [TUM PLC and Helios](user-guide/tumpl-plc-and-helios) are, and how to [report bugs and suggest for improvements/additions](user-guide/community).

<!-- TODO: add developer documents and links -->

**For developers** it contains a high level view of the architecture, the interfaces between program parts, the interfaces towards external programs, how the code can be tested, and how to contribute to the PYRA 4 codebase.

:::info

This documentation is **not an API reference**. PYRA 4's code is statically typed and all functions contain docstrings - hence, the API reference is in the codebase itself. The developer guide serves as a high level intro into the codebase structure.
