## Error Emails

Whenever PYRA encounters any errors, it sends out emails to a list of recipients. An "error resolved" email helps with self-resolving issues and team-communication - so that others get notified when one person fixed the problem.

The "CoverError" below comes from the TUM PLC Module controlling our weather protection enclosure.

**When errors occur:**

**When errors are resolved:**

    className='tw-mb-2 tw-rounded-lg'
