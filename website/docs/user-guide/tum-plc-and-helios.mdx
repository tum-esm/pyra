## What does Helios do?

Helios evaluates the current sun state - whether direct or diffuse sunlight is present. Most EM27/SUN applications require direct sunlight for measurement data to be useful. Additionally, CamTracker will loose track of the sun with very diffuse light conditions and requires a restart.

With Helios you can make your EM27/SUN measure only when favorable conditions are present which significantly prolongs the lifetime of all hardware components.

The helios hardware is made up of a transparent globe with black stripes glued to it and a translucent milky glass with a camera pointing upwards attached below.

Helios will periodically take images with that camera, process it, and evaluate shadow conditions.

The processing will detect the lense circle and cut off the outer 10% of the radius - a lot of unwanted shadows can occur on the edges due to dirt from outside. Finally it will use a canny edge filter and count the pixels where "fast transitions between light and dark" can be found. If the pixel-count is above a certain threshold (configurable), the sunlight conditions are categorized as "good".
