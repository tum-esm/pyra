# TUM PLC & Helios

The hardware for the TUM weather protection enclosure and Helios setup are not available to buy off the shelf yet. Please [contact us](/docs/contact) if you are interested in acquiring the same setup.

## What does Helios do?

Helios evaluates the current sun state - whether direct or diffuse sunlight is present. Most EM27/SUN applications require direct sunlight for measurement data to be useful. Additionally, CamTracker will loose track of the sun with very diffuse light conditions and requires a restart.

With Helios you can make your EM27/SUN measure only when favorable conditions are present which significantly prolongs the lifetime of all hardware components.

The helios hardware is made up of a transparent globe with black stripes glued to it and a translucent milky glass with a camera pointing upwards attached below.

    />

Helios will periodically take images with that camera, process it, and evaluate shadow conditions. The processing will detect the lense circle and cut off the outer 10% of the radius - a lot of unwanted shadows can occur on the edges due to dirt from outside. Finally it will use a canny edge filter and count the pixels where "fast transitions between light and dark" can be found. If the pixel-count is above a certain threshold (configurable), the sunlight conditions are categorized as "good".
