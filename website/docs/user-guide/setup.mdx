# Hot to set it up

## Software Requirements

**1. OPUS and CamTracker**

We are using OPUS 7.8.44 and Camtracker 3.9.2015.02.03.

**2. Python 3.10**

https://www.python.org/

Add environment variables to point the `python` command (and `pip`) to the Python3.10 interpreter.

TODO

<!--
Search “Edit the system environment variables” -> Environment Variables -> System variables -> Edit PATH for new Python 3.10
C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Launcher

Add pip from python/scripts also to the Environment Variables
-->

:::note

Your might not be allowed to executed `.ps1` script due to your ExecutionPolicy. This can be circumvented with the following command (credits to https://stackoverflow.com/a/49112322/8255842):

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```

## PYRA Setup Tool & Directory Structure

The [**PYRA Setup Tool**](https://github.com/tum-esm/pyra-setup-tool) can be used to install and migrate between PYRA versions. The tool looks for the "Documents" directory on your system and generates a directory structure like this:

```
📁 <DOCUMENTS DIR>
    📁 pyra
        📁 pyra-4.0.5
        📁 pyra-4.0.6
        📁 ...
```

The installation steps this tool automates:

1. Downloads each releases codebase
2. Installs all python dependencies into the global python interpreter environment
3. Downloads and runs the installer (manual steps required)
4. Creates desktop shortcuts to the `pyra-x.y.z` directory
5. (Optional) Migrates the `config.json` file (so that all settings do not have to be reentered with every upgrade)

The tool can be found here: https://github.com/tum-esm/pyra-setup-tool

## Releases

All PYRA releases can be found here: https://github.com/tum-esm/pyra/releases. Please only use the releases starting with `4.0.5`. The ones before are alpha and beta releases that have bugs and inconsistencies.
