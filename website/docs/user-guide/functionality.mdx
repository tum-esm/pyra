# Functionality

When doing measurements with an EM27/SUN, you need to run CamTracker - the software that tracks the sun position and operates the mirrors accordingly - and OPUS - the software that send commands to the EM27/SUN and collects the output data into interferogram-files.

PYRA is able handle both interfaces to start and stop measurements activity. This can either be done manually (clicking a button in the GUI, automatic, or via a CLI-command.

Based on certain conditions - time, sun angle, or sun condition (see "Helios") - PYRA decides whether to conduct measurements or not.

Additionally, PYRA permanently logs, what it is doing and sends out emails when errors occur and when they have been resolved.
