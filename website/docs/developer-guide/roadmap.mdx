# Roadmap

## Planned Updates

### Upload Improvements

<TrackOnGitHub

    text='Update: Upload Improvements'
    releaseDate='~ Mid November 2022'
/>

The current upload works good and is quite stable. However it is kind of hard to tell what the upload is currently doing from the UI alone. Additionally, this update will make the upload work for an arbitrary number of directories (not just interferograms and Helios).

### Usability Improvements

This update will add some useful UI elements and CLI commands for running Pyra's integration tests.

### Performance Improvements

Some improvements on network connections and CamTracker's large log files - they
grow infinitely long and we currently read in the whole file Pyra Core iteration.
