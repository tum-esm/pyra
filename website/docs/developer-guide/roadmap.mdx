# Roadmap

## Planned Updates

### Upload Improvements

https://github.com/tum-esm/pyra/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Update%3A+Upload+Improvements%22

The current upload works good and is quite stable. However it is kind of hard to tell what the upload is currently doing from the UI alone. Additionally, this update will make the upload work for an arbitrary number of directories (not just interferograms and Helios).

_Release Date: TBD_

### Usability Improvements

https://github.com/tum-esm/pyra/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Update%3A+Usability+Improvements%22

This update will add some useful UI elements and CLI commands for running Pyra's integration tests.

_Release Date: TBD_

### Performance Improvements

https://github.com/tum-esm/pyra/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Update%3A+Performance+Improvements%22

Some improvements on network connections and CamTracker's large log files - they grow infinitely long and we currently read in the whole file Pyra Core iteration.

_Release Date: TBD_
